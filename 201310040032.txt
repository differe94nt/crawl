請閱讀下方概述，然後按一下「瞭解更多」獲得特定主題的更多詳細資訊。您也可以從上述產品清單中進行選擇，檢視產品的隱私權聲明。本聲明中提及的某些產品、服務或功能當前可能尚未對所有市場開放。您可以在 http://www.microsoft.com/privacy 中瞭解更多有關 Microsoft 承諾保護您隱私的資訊。    Cookie 大多數 Microsoft 站點使用「Cookie」——將 Cookie 置入您的硬碟中的可以用域中網頁伺服器讀取的小型文字檔案。我們可能使用 Cookie 來儲存您的喜好設定和設定、協助登入、提供目標廣告，以及分析站點運行。 按一下這裡瞭解更多資訊 。    Cookie 及類似技術 Cookie   大多數 Microsoft 站點使用「Cookie」，將 Cookie 置入您的硬碟中的可以用域中網頁伺服器讀取的小型文字檔案。我們可能使用 Cookie 來儲存您的喜好設定和設定、協助登入、提供目標廣告，以及分析站點運行。 我們還可利用網路信標來協助交付 Cookie 及編譯分析。這其中可能包括禁止收集您的個人資訊的第三方網路信標。 您擁有各種用於控制 Cookie 和類似技術的工具，包括： 用於阻止和刪除 Cookie 的瀏覽器控制項； 廣告控制項，包括 Microsoft 的控制項，請參閱 http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ ，可退出接收行為目標廣告；以及 一些分析供應商的控制項，可以退出網路信標的資料收集。   我們對 Cookie 的使用 大多數 Microsoft 網站使用「Cookie」（網頁伺服器放置在您的硬碟上的一個小型文字檔案）。Cookie 中包含文本，域中將 Cookie 傳送給您的 Web 伺服器可讀取它們。該文本通常包含一串唯一識別您的電腦的數位和字母，但是也可能包含其他資訊。這裡是儲存在 Cookie 中的文字範例，Microsoft 可能會在您造訪我們的網站之一時將其置於您的硬碟上：E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 我們可以將 Cookie 用於：  儲存您的喜好設定和設定。 如果輸入您的城市或郵遞區號以獲取 Microsoft 站點上的當地新聞或天氣資訊，我們可能在 Cookie 中儲存此城市或郵遞區號，因此當您返回網站時將看到相應當地資訊。這樣能省去每次您造訪此站點時重複輸入相同資訊的麻煩，從而節省您的時間。 登入和驗證。 當您使用 Microsoft 帳戶登入網站或服務時，我們會將您的唯一 ID 號和登入時間儲存於您硬碟上的加密 Cookie 中。此 Cookie 能讓您自由瀏覽網站的網頁，而不需要再次登入每個網頁。當您登出時，將會從您的電腦刪除這些 Cookie。我們也會使用 Cookie 來改進登入體驗。舉例來說，您的電子郵件地址可能會儲存在某個 Cookie 裡，當您登出後，此 Cookie 仍將保留在您的電腦裡。此 Cookie 能預先填入您的電子郵件地址，因此您下次登入時，只需輸入您的密碼即可。如果您使用公用電腦或不希望儲存這項資料，可以在登入頁面上選取適當的選項按鈕，系統即不會使用 Cookie。 目標廣告。 在向您顯示聯機廣告時，我們將在您的裝置上置入一個或多個永久 Cookie，以便在每次向您顯示廣告時識別您的裝置。由於我們可以在很多不同的網站以及我們的廣告商和出版商合作夥伴上提供廣告，隨著時間推移，我們能夠匯總以下資訊：網頁類型、內容，以及您或使用您的電腦的人員造訪或檢視的廣告。此資訊有多種使用目的，例如，協助我們確保您不會周而複始地看到相同廣告。我們還使用此資訊來協助選擇並顯示我們認為您可能感興趣的目標廣告。您可以找到更多關於使用 Cookie 的資訊，包括 Microsoft Advertising 隱私權聲明 的如何退出接收來自 Microsoft 的目標廣告。 站點分析。 我們可能使用 Cookie 來計算網頁或者服務的獨立訪客人數，或者開發關於我們的網站和服務運作情況的其他綜合統計資料。這些分析協助我們運行以及改善這些網站和服務的性能。 以下圖表中列出了我們常用的一些 Cookie。此清單並不詳盡，而是旨在闡述部分我們設定 Cookie 的原因。如果您造訪我們的網站之一，該站點可能設定部分或者所有如下 Cookie：  Cookie 名稱  描述  MUID 識別 Microsoft 網站的唯一瀏覽器。這是以廣告、網站分析和其他運行為目的。 ANON 包含 ANID，即一種用作協助識別使用者可能喜歡的廣告的唯一識別字。如果使用者已選擇將退出與他/她的 Microsoft 帳戶相關聯，那麼它也被用來儲存使用者退出 Microsoft 行為目標廣告的選擇。  CC 包含透過逆向尋找 IP 位址確定的國家代碼。 Microsoft 帳號驗證 當使用者用 Microsoft 帳號登入時使用的驗證 Cookie（例如 RPSTAuth、MSNRPSAuth、KievRPSAuth）。  NAP 包含基於使用者的 Windows Live 簡介中的使用者國家/地區、郵遞區號、年齡、性別、語言和職業的加密版本（如果已知）。  MH 出現在 Microsoft 與廣告商合作的聯名品牌網站，此 Cookie 識別廣告商，從而選擇正確的廣告。  ACH01 保留關於使用者按一下的廣告，以及按一下廣告的位置的資訊。  TOptOut 表示使用者已經表明他/她不希望收到 Microsoft 交付的行為目標廣告。  除了 Microsoft 可能在您造訪我們網站時設定的 Cookie 之外，造訪 Microsoft 站點時，第三方也可能在您的硬碟中設定特定 Cookie。在某些情況下，這是因為我們雇傭第三方代表我們提供特定服務，例如站點分析。在其他情況下，是因為我們的網頁包含來自第三方的內容或廣告，例如其他廣告網路交付的視訊、新內容或者廣告。因為您的瀏覽器透過與這些第三方的 Web 伺服器相連來檢索內容，這些第三方能夠設定或讀取他們在您的硬碟中擁有的 Cookie。  如何控制 Cookie  用於阻止 Cookie 的瀏覽器控制項。 多數 Web 瀏覽器自動接受 Cookie，但是您可以修改瀏覽器設定來拒絕使用 Cookie。  例如，在 Internet Explorer 9 中，您可以透過採取如下步驟阻止 Cookie： 按一下「工具」，然後選擇「網際網路選項」 按一下視窗頂部的「隱私權」標籤 向上或向下拖動滑杆，選擇想要套用至阻止 Cookie 的規則。  造訪 http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ 可查看在其他瀏覽器中阻止 Cookie 的指示。 請注意，若選擇阻止 Cookie，可能無法登入或使用 Microsoft 網站及服務中依賴 Cookie 才能提供的其他互動功能，且某些依賴 Cookie 的廣告喜好設定可能也無法發揮作用。  用於刪除 Cookie 的瀏覽器控制項。 如果接收 Cookie，您可以在以後將其刪除。  例如，在 Internet Explorer 9 中，您可以透過採取如下步驟刪除 Cookie： 按一下「工具」，然後選擇「網際網路選項」 在「常規」標籤的「瀏覽歷程記錄」中按一下「刪除」按鈕 在快顯視窗中，選擇「Cookie」旁邊的方塊 按一下「刪除」按鈕 造訪 http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ 可查看在其他瀏覽器中刪除 Cookie 的指示。 請注意，若您選擇刪除 Cookie，這些 Cookie 所控制的一切設定及喜好設定（包括廣告喜好設定）都會刪除並可能需要重新建立。  「請勿追蹤」和追蹤防護的瀏覽器控制項。 一些較新的瀏覽器已經結合了「請勿追蹤」功能。這些功能中的大多數功能在啟用時會向您造訪的網站傳送表示您不希望被追蹤的訊號或意願。即使您已經表達了意願，但是這些網站（或者這些網站上的第三方內容）可能繼續致力於可能被您視為追蹤的行動，這取決於該網站的隱私慣例。 Internet Explorer 9 和 10 擁有被稱作追蹤保護的功能，協助防止您前往的網站自動向第三方內容供應商傳送關於您造訪的詳情。當您添加追蹤保護清單時，Internet Explorer 將阻止來自任何被列入阻止網站清單的任何第三方內容，包括 Cookie。透過限制對這些網站的造訪，Internet Explorer 將限制這些第三方網站收集關於您的資訊。當您啟用追蹤防護清單時，Internet Explorer 將向您造訪的網站傳送「請勿追蹤」訊號或意願。此外，如果您願意，亦可在 Internet Explorer 10 中單獨「開啟」或「關閉」DNT。如欲瞭解關於追蹤防護清單和請勿追蹤的詳情，請參閱 Internet Explorer 隱私權聲明 或 Internet Explorer 說明 。  廣告退出控制項。 因為 Cookie 可能被用於多種目的，因此對行為目標廣告反感的使用者可以選擇接收 Cookie，而退出該特定用途。聯機廣告行業的公司已經開發出協助保護使用者隱私的指導和程式，這些行業程式包括您可以造訪的網頁退出接收來自所有參與公司（包括 Microsoft）的行為目標廣告。這些頁面包括：  Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) 消費者選擇頁面： http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) 退出頁面： http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp 在歐洲，您還可以造訪您的線上選擇： http://www.youronlinechoices.com/  獨立廣告公司也可能提供其自有的退出功能，此外還有更多高級廣告選擇。例如， http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ 中提供 Microsoft 的廣告喜好設定和退出控制項。請注意，退出不意味著您將停止獲得廣告，或者看到更少的廣告，然而，如果您選擇退出，那麼您接收的廣告將不再有行為目標。此外，退出不能停止資訊轉到我們的伺服器，但它會停止建立或更新行為廣告所用的設定檔。  我們對網路信標的使用  Microsoft 網頁可能包含稱為網路信標的電子影像（有時也稱為單圖元 gif），它們可用於協助傳遞我們網站上的 Cookie，並允許我們對造訪過這些網頁的使用者進行計數，以及提供聯名品牌服務。我們可能會在促銷電子郵件或新聞稿中包括網路信標，以便確定是否已打開郵件並對其進行了操作。 我們也可能與在 Microsoft 網站上發佈廣告的其他公司合作，將網路信標放置在他們的網站上或者廣告中，以便我們能夠獲得有關以下內容的統計資訊：使用者在按一下 Microsoft 網站上的廣告多少次後才能產生購買行為或在廣告發佈者的網站上執行其他操作。 最後，Microsoft 站點可能包含來自第三方的網路信標來協助我們編制關於我們促銷公司或其他網頁運營效率的統計資訊。這些網路信標可能允許第三方設定或者讀取您電腦上的 Cookie。我們禁止第三方使用我們站點的網路信標來收集或存取您的個人資訊。然而，您可以透過按一下如下各分析供應商的連結，退出資料收集或被這些第三方分析公司使用：  Omniture (Adobe)： http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html Nielsen： http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices Coremetrics： http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout Visible Measures： http://corp.visiblemeasures.com/viewer-settings Google Analytics： http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout （需要您安裝瀏覽器外掛）  其他類似技術 除了標準的 Cookie 和網路信標，網站可以使用其他技術來儲存和讀取您電腦上的資料檔案。透過在本機儲存特定檔案，可以保留您的偏好，或者改善速度和性能。但是，如同標準 Cookie，它也可以被用來儲存您電腦的唯一識別字，以便透過其追蹤行為。這些技術包括「Local Shared Objects」（或者「Flash Cookie」），以及 Silverlight 應用程式儲存。  「Local Shared Objects」或者「Flash Cookie」。 使用 Adobe Flash 技術的網站可能使用「Local Shared Objects」或者「Flash Cookie」在您的電腦中儲存資料。請注意，清理 Flash Cookie 的功能可能無法透過標準 Cookie 的瀏覽器設定控制，因為這會根據不同瀏覽器而有所區別。如欲管理或阻止 Flash Ｃookie，請轉到 http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html 。  Silverlight 應用程式儲存。 使用 Microsoft Silverlight 技術的網站或者應用程式也能夠透過使用 Silverlight 應用程式儲存來儲存資料。如欲瞭解如何管理或阻止這些儲存，請造訪 Silverlight 。        我們收集的資訊 收集您的資訊   Microsoft 收集多種資訊，以提高運行效率，並盡我們所能為您提供最佳產品、服務和體驗。 當您登記、登入，以及使用我們的站點和服務時，我們會收集資訊。我們也可能從其他公司獲得資訊。 我們以多種方式收集此資訊，包括網頁表單、 Cookie 、Web 登入等技術，以及您的電腦或者其他裝置上的軟體。  Microsoft

位址判定您所在的大致地理區域，從而為您定制某些適合您所在地理區域的服務。 我們也可能使用資訊來與您通訊，例如當訂閱到期時通知您，讓您知道安全更新可用時間，或者讓您知道何時需要採取措施來保持帳號的有效性。 Microsoft 免費提供許多我們的站點和服務，因為它們都由廣告支援。為了普及這些服務，我們收集的資訊可能被用於協助優化廣告的可見性（透過提高與您的相關性）。

合作夥伴的產品、網站和服務。當您建立 Microsoft 帳號時，我們要求您提供特定資訊。當您使用 Mircosoft 帳號登入站點或服務時，我們代表該站點或服務收集特定資訊來驗證您的身份，從而避免您遭受惡意的帳號使用，並保護 Microsoft 帳號服務的有效性和安全性。我們也向您使用 Mircosoft 帳號登入的站點或服務傳送特定資訊。 如欲檢視關於 Microsoft 帳號的其他詳情，包括如何建立和使用 Microsoft 帳號；如何編輯帳號資訊，以及我們如何收集和使用有關 Microsoft 帳號的資訊，請按一下「瞭解更多」。  Microsoft 帳號（以前稱為「Windows Live ID」和「Microsoft Passport」）是一種服務，此服務允許您登入 Microsoft 產品、網站和服務，以及所選的 Microsoft 合作夥伴的產品、網站和服務。 其中包括如下產品、網站和服務：  Xbox Live 、 Microsoft Hotmail 、 Microsoft Office 2013 、 Windows Phone 和 Windows 8 。 建立 Microsoft 帳號。 您可以提供電子郵件地址、密碼和其他「帳號證明」，例如備用電子郵件地址、電話號碼和問題以及保密答案，在 這裡 建立 Microsoft 帳號。我們僅僅出於安全目的使用您的「帳號證明」，例如在您無法存取 Microsoft 帳號以及需要協助時，或者在您無法存取關聯 Microsoft 帳號的電子郵件地址而重設您的密碼時用來驗證您的身份。某些服務可能會要求增強安全性，在這種情況下，將要求您建立其他安全密鑰。您用來登入 Microsoft 帳號的電子郵件地址和密碼是您使用我們的網路驗證的「認證」。此外，會將一個 64 位的唯一 ID 號分配給您的認證，用於標識您的認證和關聯資訊。 當您建立 Microsoft 帳號時，我們將要求您提供如下人口統計資訊：性別、國家、出生日期和郵遞區號。按照當地法律的要求，我們可能使用出生日期來驗證兒童獲得家長或監護人對於使用 Microsoft 帳號的相應許可。此外，我們的聯機廣告系統使用這些人口統計資訊為您提供您可能覺得有用的關於產品和服務的個人化廣告，但是我們的廣告系統絕不會獲得您的姓名和聯絡資訊。換言之，我們的廣告系統不包含或使用任何專門和直接標識您身份的資訊（例如您的姓名、電子信箱位址和電話號碼）。如果您不想接收個人化廣告，您可以透過使用 Microsoft 帳號造訪 此頁面 登記您的偏好，因此無論何時您使用 Microsoft 帳號登入網站或服務，我們的廣告系統都不會為您提供個人化廣告。有關 Microsoft 如何收集和使用您的個人資訊來投放廣告，請參閱 Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement 。 登入您的 Microsoft 帳號時，您可以使用 Microsoft 提供的電子郵件地址（例如以 live.com、hotmail.com 或者 msn.com 結尾），或者第三方提供的電子郵件地址（例如以 gmail.com 或者 yahoo.com 結尾）。 一旦建立 Microsoft 帳號，我們將向您傳送電子郵件要求您驗證自己是關聯您的 Microsoft 帳號的電子郵件地址的所有者。此過程旨在驗證電子郵件地址的有效性，並且有助於防止在未經電子郵件所有者允許的情況下使用電子郵件地址。此後，我們將使用該電子郵件地址向您傳送有關您使用 Microsoft 產品和服務的通訊，在當地法律許可的情況下，我們也可能向您傳送關於 Microsoft 產品和服務的促銷電子郵件。如欲瞭解關於管理接收促銷通訊的更多資訊，請造訪 通訊 。 如果您嘗試登記 Microsoft 帳號，卻發現另一個人已經用您的電子郵件地址作為使用者名稱的認證，您可以聯絡我們，並要求其他人採用不同的使用者名稱，從而在建立您的認證時可以使用您的電子郵件地址。 使用您的 Microsoft 帳號登入軟體、站點或服務。 當您使用 Mircosoft 帳號登入站點或服務時，我們代表該站點或服務收集特定資訊來驗證您的身份，從而避免您遭受惡意的帳號使用，並保護 Microsoft 帳號服務的有效性和安全性。例如，登入時，Microsoft 帳號服務接收並記錄您的認證和其他資訊，例如指定為您的認證的 64 位唯一 ID 號、IP 位址、您的 Web 瀏覽器版本，以及時間和日期。此外，如果您使用 Microsoft 帳號登入裝置或者安裝在裝置上的軟體，將給此裝置分配一個隨機唯一 ID，當您此後使用 Microsoft 帳號登入站點或服務時，此隨機唯一 ID 將被將作為您認證的一部分被傳送至 Microsoft 帳號服務。Microsoft 帳號服務將如下資訊傳送至您已經登入的站點或服務：當您處於不同的登入會話時，允許站點或服務確定您的專有身份，您的帳號所分配的版本號（每次您更改登入資訊時，都將分配新版本號）；您的電子郵件地址是否已經確認；您的帳號是否已經無效。 一些允許您使用 Microsoft 帳號登入的第三方站點和服務需要透過您的電子郵件地址來提供服務。在這些情況下，登入時，Microsoft 將為您提供該站點或服務的電子郵件地址，但不是密碼。然而，如果您使用站點或服務建立認證，您建立認證的站點或服務可能會限制對認證資訊的存取，以協助您重新設定密碼或提供其他支援服務。 如果您接收來自第三方（例如學校、企業、網際網路服務供應商，或者管理域的管理員）的帳號，那麼該第三方可能擁有您帳號的許可權，包括可以重設您的密碼、檢視您帳號的使用或簡介資料、在您的帳號中讀取或儲存內容，以及停用或取消您的帳號。在這種情況下，必須遵守 Microsoft 服務協定 ，以及來自第三方的任何其他使用條款。如果您是管理域的管理員，並且為您的使用者提供 Microsoft 帳號，則需要對這些帳號內出現的所有行為負責。 請注意，如隱私權聲明所述，一些允許您使用 Microsoft 帳號登入的站點和服務可以使用或共用您向他們提供的電子郵件地址或者其他個人資訊。但是，只有在為完成您請求的服務或事務的情況下，他們才能與第三方共用由 Microsoft 帳號提供的唯一 ID 號。使用 Microsoft 帳號的所有站點或服務都必須張貼隱私權聲明，但我們並不控制或監視這些站點的隱私慣例，並且其隱私慣例可以改變。 您應該詳細檢視所登入各網站的隱私權聲明，以確定各個網站或服務將如何運用所收集的資訊。 存取您的個人資訊。 您可以轉到 帳號 來存取您的個人資訊。若您的 Microsoft 帳號不屬於管理域，則可變更使用者名稱。您可以隨時變更密碼、備用電子郵件地址以及問題和秘密的答案。您也可能透過轉到 帳號 ，然後「關閉您的帳號」來關閉您的 Microsoft 帳號。如果您的帳號屬於前述的「管理域」，則有另一個特殊的程序可用來關閉您的帳號。請注意，如果您是 MSN 或 Windows Live 使用者，並造訪帳號，則您可能被重定向到那些站點。 有關 Microsoft 帳號的更多資訊，請參閱 Microsoft account 網站 (英文) 。       其他重要隱私資訊 其他資訊

It does not apply to Microsoft sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

Cookies   Most Microsoft Sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze  site operations. Click here to learn more .    Cookies & Similar Technologies Cookies   Most Microsoft sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze site operations. We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information. You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including: Browser controls to block and delete cookies; Advertising controls, including Microsoft's controls at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ , to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted ads; and Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in web beacons.   Our Use of Cookies Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 We may use cookies for:  Storing your Preferences and Settings. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site. Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement . Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:  Cookie name  Description  MUID Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user&rsquo;s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.  CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup. Microsoft account authentication Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.  NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user&rsquo;s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user&rsquo;s Windows Live profile.  MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.  ACH01 Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.  TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.  In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties&rsquo; web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.  How to Control Cookies  Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.  Browser Controls to Delete Cookies . If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button On the pop-up, select the box next to &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; Click the "Delete" button Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.  Browser Controls for &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites&rsquo; privacy practices. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. Additionally, in Internet Explorer 10 you may switch DNT "off" or "on" independently, if you'd like. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help .  Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users&rsquo; privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:  Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/  Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ . Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.

Microsoft account Microsoft account    Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. We also send certain information to a site or service you have signed into with your Microsoft account.    To view additional details about Microsoft account, including how to create and use a Microsoft account, how to edit account information, and how we collect and use information relating to a Microsoft account, please click on Learn More.     Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. This includes products, websites and services such as the following:  Xbox Live ;   Microsoft Hotmail ;   Microsoft Office 2013 ;   Windows Phone ; and   Windows 8 .   Creating a Microsoft account.   You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other "account proofs", such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your "account proofs" for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.    When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads. For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the  Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement .    You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.    Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications .    If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.    Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.    When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.    Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.    If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.    Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary.    You should carefully review the privacy  statement for each site you sign into in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.   Accessing your personal information.   You can access your personal information by going to account .  You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain. You can  always change your password, alternate email address, phone number, and question and secret answer. You may also close your Microsoft account by going to  account , and then  "Close your account." If your account is in a managed domain, as described above, there may be a special process for closing your account. Please note that if you are an  MSN or a Windows Live user, if you go to account, you may be redirected to account for those sites.

It does not apply to Microsoft sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

Cookies   Most Microsoft Sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze  site operations. Click here to learn more .    Cookies & Similar Technologies Cookies   Most Microsoft sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze site operations. We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information. You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including: Browser controls to block and delete cookies; Advertising controls, including Microsoft's controls at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ , to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted ads; and Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in web beacons.   Our Use of Cookies Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 We may use cookies for:  Storing your Preferences and Settings. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site. Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement . Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:  Cookie name  Description  MUID Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user&rsquo;s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.  CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup. Microsoft account authentication Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.  NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user&rsquo;s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user&rsquo;s Windows Live profile.  MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.  ACH01 Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.  TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.  In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties&rsquo; web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.  How to Control Cookies  Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.  Browser Controls to Delete Cookies . If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button On the pop-up, select the box next to &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; Click the "Delete" button Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.  Browser Controls for &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites&rsquo; privacy practices. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. Additionally, in Internet Explorer 10 you may switch DNT "off" or "on" independently, if you'd like. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help .  Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users&rsquo; privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:  Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/  Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ . Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.  Our Use of Web Beacons  Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. We prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. Nevertheless, you may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers:  Omniture (Adobe): http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html Nielsen: http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices Coremetrics: http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout Visible Measures: http://corp.visiblemeasures.com/viewer-settings Google Analytics: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout (requires you to install a browser add-on)  Other Similar Technologies In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior.

You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other "account proofs", such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your "account proofs" for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.    When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads.

Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications .    If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.    Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.    When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.    Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.

In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.    Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested.

When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement . Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:  Cookie name  Description  MUID Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user&rsquo;s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.  CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup. Microsoft account authentication Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.  NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user&rsquo;s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user&rsquo;s Windows Live profile.  MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.  ACH01 Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.  TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.  In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties&rsquo; web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.  How to Control Cookies  Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.  Browser Controls to Delete Cookies . If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button On the pop-up, select the box next to &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; Click the "Delete" button Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.  Browser Controls for &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites&rsquo; privacy practices. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. Additionally, in Internet Explorer 10 you may switch DNT "off" or "on" independently, if you'd like. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help .  Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users&rsquo; privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:  Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/  Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ . Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.

This includes products, websites and services such as the following:  Xbox Live ;   Microsoft Hotmail ;   Microsoft Office 2013 ;   Windows Phone ; and   Windows 8 .   Creating a Microsoft account.   You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other "account proofs", such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your "account proofs" for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.    When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law.

If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads.

You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.    Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications .    If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.    Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.    When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.    Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.    If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.    Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested.

Cookies   Most Microsoft Sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze  site operations. Click here to learn more .    Cookies & Similar Technologies Cookies   Most Microsoft sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze site operations. We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information. You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including: Browser controls to block and delete cookies; Advertising controls, including Microsoft's controls at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ , to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted ads; and Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in web beacons.   Our Use of Cookies Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 We may use cookies for:  Storing your Preferences and Settings. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site. Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement . Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:  Cookie name  Description  MUID Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user&rsquo;s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.  CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup. Microsoft account authentication Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.  NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user&rsquo;s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user&rsquo;s Windows Live profile.  MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.  ACH01 Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.  TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.  In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties&rsquo; web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.  How to Control Cookies  Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.  Browser Controls to Delete Cookies . If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button On the pop-up, select the box next to &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; Click the "Delete" button Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.  Browser Controls for &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites&rsquo; privacy practices. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. Additionally, in Internet Explorer 10 you may switch DNT "off" or "on" independently, if you'd like. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help .  Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users&rsquo; privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:  Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/  Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ . Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.  Our Use of Web Beacons  Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations.

When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. We also send certain information to a site or service you have signed into with your Microsoft account.    To view additional details about Microsoft account, including how to create and use a Microsoft account, how to edit account information, and how we collect and use information relating to a Microsoft account, please click on Learn More.     Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. This includes products, websites and services such as the following:  Xbox Live ;   Microsoft Hotmail ;   Microsoft Office 2013 ;   Windows Phone ; and   Windows 8 .   Creating a Microsoft account.   You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other "account proofs", such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your "account proofs" for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.    When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads. For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the  Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement .    You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.    Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications .    If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.    Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.    When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.    Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.    If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.    Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary.    You should carefully review the privacy  statement for each site you sign into in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.   Accessing your personal information.   You can access your personal information by going to account .  You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain. You can  always change your password, alternate email address, phone number, and question and secret answer. You may also close your Microsoft account by going to  account , and then  "Close your account." If your account is in a managed domain, as described above, there may be a special process for closing your account. Please note that if you are an  MSN or a Windows Live user, if you go to account, you may be redirected to account for those sites.

It does not apply to Microsoft sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

Cookies   Most Microsoft Sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze  site operations. Click here to learn more .    Cookies & Similar Technologies Cookies   Most Microsoft sites use "cookies," small text files that can be read by a web server in the domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to store your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; provide targeted ads; and analyze site operations. We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information. You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including: Browser controls to block and delete cookies; Advertising controls, including Microsoft's controls at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ , to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted ads; and Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in web beacons.   Our Use of Cookies Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 We may use cookies for:  Storing your Preferences and Settings. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site. Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement . Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:  Cookie name  Description  MUID Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user&rsquo;s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.  CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup. Microsoft account authentication Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.  NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user&rsquo;s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user&rsquo;s Windows Live profile.  MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.  ACH01 Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.  TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.  In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties&rsquo; web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.  How to Control Cookies  Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.  Browser Controls to Delete Cookies . If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button On the pop-up, select the box next to &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; Click the "Delete" button Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ . Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.  Browser Controls for &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites&rsquo; privacy practices. Internet Explorer 9 and 10 have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. Additionally, in Internet Explorer 10 you may switch DNT "off" or "on" independently, if you'd like. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help .  Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users&rsquo; privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:  Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/  Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice/ . Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from going to our servers, but it does stop our creation or updating of profiles that might be used for behavioral advertising.  Our Use of Web Beacons  Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations.

Microsoft account Microsoft account    Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. We also send certain information to a site or service you have signed into with your Microsoft account.    To view additional details about Microsoft account, including how to create and use a Microsoft account, how to edit account information, and how we collect and use information relating to a Microsoft account, please click on Learn More.     Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. This includes products, websites and services such as the following:  Xbox Live ;   Microsoft Hotmail ;   Microsoft Office 2013 ;   Windows Phone ; and   Windows 8 .   Creating a Microsoft account.   You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other "account proofs", such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your "account proofs" for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.    When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads. For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the  Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement .    You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.    Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications .    If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.    Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.    When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.    Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.    If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.    Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary.    You should carefully review the privacy  statement for each site you sign into in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.   Accessing your personal information.   You can access your personal information by going to account .  You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain.
